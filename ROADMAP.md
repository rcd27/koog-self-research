# Roadmap
`(List<Tool>) -> List<Skill>`
* ~~Accept a list of Tools, validate~~
* Scan given tools, make a brief report for each tool 
* Find "matching tools"(the ones that return/need same data)
* High-level overview about probable tasks for "matching tools"
* Delegate for researchers
* Summarize each research
* Fold researches to skills (List<Research> -> List<Skill>)

## Definition of Done
* 80%+ evaluation test result for predefined available tools and agent capabilities
