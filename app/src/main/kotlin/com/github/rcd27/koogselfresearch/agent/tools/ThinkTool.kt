@LLMDescription(
    """
Tool for strategic reflection on research progress and decision-making.

Use this tool after each search to analyze results and plan next steps systematically.
This creates a deliberate pause in the research workflow for quality decision-making.

When to use:
- After receiving search results: What key information did I find?
- Before deciding next steps: Do I have enough to answer comprehensively?
- When assessing research gaps: What specific information am I still missing?
- Before concluding research: Can I provide a complete answer now?

Reflection should address:
1. Analysis of current findings - What concrete information have I gathered?
2. Gap assessment - What crucial information is still missing?
3. Quality evaluation - Do I have sufficient evidence/examples for a good answer?
4. Strategic decision - Should I continue searching or provide my answer?
